This work was done in Qt Creator 12.0.2 (Community). And correspondences to the following task: A table and an area for displaying graphical information must be present on the work form
at the same time. In the graphics area, using the mouse
, the user enters, edits (moves) or deletes the points of the shape,
we connect them sequentially with segments. The graphic information that is being changed should
be automatically displayed in the table as coordinates of the points of the shape. The program interface is presented below.
